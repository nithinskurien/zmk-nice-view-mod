# Custom nice-view widget mod (ZMK)

This is a repo that has a mod for the main driver screen (left side) nice-view widget. It gives a cleaner design to the original widget and also adds functionality to a caps lock indicator.
- The wpm graph is now capped to 120 wpm with each line reprenting 30 wpm. I was frustated by how the wpm line earlier just showed relative typing speed to what was typed a few seconds ago.
- The bluetooth profile number is now collapsed to just one small section instead of taking so much space on the screen as earlier
- There is a custom caps lock indicator and implementation.
- A looping infinite animation at the bottom
